🧠 What is gcc?

gcc stands for GNU Compiler Collection. Despite the name, it's not just for C — it’s a whole suite of compilers for different languages.

Here’s what it includes:
Command	Language it compiles
gcc	C
g++	C++
gfortran	Fortran
gcj	Java (deprecated)
go	Go (not the same as Google's Go)
🧩 So why are there both gcc and g++?

They’re actually different frontends to the same backend compiler system. The difference is how they treat the input code and which libraries they link by default:

    gcc is for compiling C code.

    g++ is for compiling C++ code:

        It enables C++ features (like classes, templates, etc.).

        It automatically links against the C++ standard library (libstdc++).

        It treats .cpp files appropriately.

    You can compile C++ code with gcc, but you'll run into issues unless you explicitly tell it to use C++ mode and link C++ libraries manually. That’s why g++ exists — it handles this automatically.

🔧 TL;DR

    gcc = base C compiler in the GNU Compiler Collection

    g++ = C++ compiler in the same collection

    They both invoke the same underlying toolchain, but behave differently

So if you're writing C++ code (which you are), use g++, and make sure CLion is set up to use that for the C++ compiler.

Let me know if you want to see an example of how gcc and g++ behave differently with the same .cpp file
